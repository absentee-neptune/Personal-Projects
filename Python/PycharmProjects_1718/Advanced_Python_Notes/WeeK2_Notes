object = collection of data (attributes, members, or properties) and associated behavior (methods)
class defines a class of object
    acts as a blueprint
    attributes
    whereas object is a particular instance of a class
association = generic relationship between classes
    an asterisk = 'many go to other', wildcard

Composition and Aggregation
composition = collecting several object to create a new one

OO Analysis - look at the problem and identify the objects and interaction between objects
    what needs to be done
    a set of requirements
OO Design - converting requirements into an implementation specification
    how things should be done


Object Oriented Analysis
    (1) Identify classes objects - look at nouns in the problem description
    (2) Define attributes for each class - adjectives and nouns
    (3) Define behaviors for each class - verbs
    (4) Define relationships between classes
